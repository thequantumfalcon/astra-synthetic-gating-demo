Zenodo upload (quick steps)

1) Sign in: https://zenodo.org
2) Click: Upload → New upload

3) Upload files (choose one approach):

   Option A (single-file, simplest):
   - Upload: zenodo_deposit_2026-01-16_v5_final.zip
   - Note: Zenodo will treat this as one downloadable file (it will not display the inner files).

   Option B (recommended for readability):
   - Upload the *contents* of: zenodo_deposit_2026-01-16_v5_final/
     This shows paper.pdf and the payload zips directly in the Zenodo file list.

4) Metadata (suggested):
   - Upload type: Publication (or Dataset is also acceptable; keep consistent)
   - Title: ASTRA synthetic gating demo (preprint + reproducibility package)
   - Authors/Creators: Thomas Albrecht
     Affiliation: Independent Researcher
   - Version: v5
   - License: CC-BY-4.0
   - Keywords: preprint; reproducibility; synthetic gating; signal processing; data preprocessing; gating; synthetic experiment
   - Description: Use the text in zenodo_deposit_2026-01-16_v5_final/zenodo.json (field "description")

5) (Recommended) Click “Reserve DOI” before publishing.
6) Publish.

After you later have an external preprint identifier (optional):
- Edit the Zenodo record → add a Related identifier (isSupplementTo or isIdenticalTo) pointing at that URL.
- Optionally create a new Zenodo version if you change any files.

Local contents:
- zenodo_deposit_2026-01-16_v5_final.zip is the single-file upload option.
- zenodo_deposit_2026-01-16_v5_final/ contains the unpacked deposit (README, CITATION.cff, zenodo.json, SHA256SUMS.txt, and the payload zips/PDF).
- zenodo_deposit_2026-01-16_v5_final/ASTRA_Source_v5_unpacked/ is an optional convenience copy of the LaTeX source for browsing.

  "description": "This deposit provides a citable archive of a preprint and reproducibility materials for the ASTRA synthetic gating demo (v5).\n\nScope: a controlled, fixed-seed toy experiment demonstrating how an amplitude-based gating (preprocessing) step can suppress a short transient prior to downstream scoring.\n\nContents:\n- paper.pdf (compiled manuscript)\n- ASTRA_Source_v5.zip (clean LaTeX sources; includes paper.bbl)\n- ASTRA_Ancillary_v5.zip (logs/tables/repro artifacts)\n- COMPILE_AUDIT_25X_v5.txt (25× clean-room compile audit)\n- SHA256SUMS.txt (integrity checksums)\n\nNotes: This record does not contain proprietary detector data and does not claim any astrophysical detection; it is a method-focused synthetic demonstration with audited artifacts.",

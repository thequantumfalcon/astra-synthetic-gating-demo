\subsection{Single-run reproducibility}
A single run of the script produces a specific set of reported values and artifacts. The log file is intended to be the primary ``paper trail'' for reviewers who want to check numerical values without opening binary arrays.

\subsection{Monte Carlo stability (optional)}
If the Monte Carlo mode is executed, the script emits a small summary table capturing the distribution of outcome metrics across seeds.

\subsection{Interpretation (bounded)}
In this toy setting, gating tends to reduce extrema, which in turn reduces peak-based summary statistics. The magnitude of this effect depends on the chosen threshold $\tau$ and the injected transient's amplitude relative to the noise scale $\sigma$.

This manuscript does not claim that the demonstrated magnitude transfers to real instruments; rather, it demonstrates the \emph{mechanism} clearly and reproducibly.
